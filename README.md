# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-System
A lot of analysis over existing systems in the health care industry considered only one disease at a time. For example, one system is used to analysediabetes, another is used to analyse diabetes retinopathy, and another system is used to predict heart disease. Maximum systems focus on a particular disease. When an organization wants to analyse their patient’s health reports then they have to deploy many models. The approach in the existing system is useful to analyse only particular diseases. In multiple diseases prediction system a user can analyse more than one disease on a single website. The user doesn’t need to traverse different places in order to predict whether he/she has a particular disease or not. In multiple diseases prediction system, the user needs to select the name of the particular disease, enter its parameters and just click on submit. The corresponding machine learning model will be invoked and it would predict the output and display it on the screen.
